# Day and Night Cycle with Moon Phases

## Project Description
This project showcases a visually engaging **day and night cycle** with dynamic moon phases, moving clouds, and background audio. The program uses p5.js to create an interactive experience where **clicking on the canvas alternates between day and night**, while also progressing through the moon phases. The serene *Clair de Lune* by Claude Debussy plays in the background to enhance the atmosphere.
