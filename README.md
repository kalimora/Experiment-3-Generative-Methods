Day and Night Cycle with Moon Phases
Project Description
This project showcases a visually engaging day and night cycle with dynamic moon phases, moving clouds, and background audio. The program leverages p5.js to create an interactive experience where clicking on the canvas alternates between day and night while also progressing through the moon phases. The moving clouds during the day and the calm moonlit night, accompanied by Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune, create a tranquil and immersive environment.

Features
Day and Night Cycle:

Clicking on the canvas toggles between day and night.
The sun appears during the day, while the moon cycles through its phases at night.
Moon Phases:

Moon phases progress with each click during the night, showing the full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent.
Dynamic Clouds:

Clouds move across the sky during the day, resetting once they exit the canvas.
Background Music:

The serene Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy plays in the background throughout the experience.
